# OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) models have two parameters (a slope and an offset), but these haven't been set in our model yet. 
# We need to train (fit) our model to find these values so that the model can reliably estimate dogs' boot size based on their harness size.

# Train (fit) the model so that it creates a line that fits our data. 
# We will look at how this method works in a later unit.

# So that a computer can understand our objective, we need to provide our goal as code snippet called an objective function (cost function). 
# Objective functions judge whether the model is doing a good job (estimating boot size well) or bad job (estimating boot size badly).

# Data refers to the information that we provide to the model (also known as inputs). 
# In our scenario, this is harness size.
# Data also refers to information that the objective function might need. 
# For example, if our objective function reports whether the model guessed the boot size correctly, it will need to know the correct boot size! 
# This is why in our previous exercise, we provided both harness sizes and the correct answers to the training code.

# During training, the model makes a prediction, and the objective function calculates how well it performed. 
# The optimizer is code that then changes the modelâ€™s parameters so the model will do a better job next time.


# It's common to build, train, then use a model while we are just learning about machine learning; 
# but in the real world, we don't want to train the model every time we want to make a prediction.
